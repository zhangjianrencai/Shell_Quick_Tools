Description: 
Adding batch_ftp.sh. 
That is an old script I wrote in 2009.
It is to help users to download/upload the files you customized in the embeded ftp script automatically.
(FTP script started from Line No. 198 around, you can start from there quickly)
For more details, please customize the code easily and give a try.
Enjoy :)

Description: 
Adding setup_aix.sh and setup_hpux.sh. 
1. setup_aix.sh was written in 2011.
2. setup_hpux.sh was written in 2012.
3. The functions of the two scrpts are similar. 
They were to help me to initiate a AIX/HPUX environments automatically to a 
comfortable working environment.
If you once worked on AIX/HPUX before, you may know how tough it is to use those 
UNIX OS without doing some user configuration and patching some commom packages
Enjoy :)
