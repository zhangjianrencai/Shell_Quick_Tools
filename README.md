This is a repository for accomodating Shell smart/quick/useful scripts written by me.

Description: 
Adding batch_ftp.sh. 
That is an old script I wrote in 2009.
It is to help users to download/upload the files you customized in the embeded ftp script automatically.
(FTP script started from Line No. 198 around, you can start from there quickly)
For more details, please customize the code easily and give a try.
Enjoy :)
